Rigorous Testing for Peak Performance
Every refurbished fuel injector undergoes an extensive multi-step testing process to ensure consistent and reliable performance. Our testing process is designed to replicate real-world conditions and verify that each injector meets or exceeds OEM standards. Here’s how we test our injectors:
1. Idle Test:
   * Simulates the injector’s performance at idle speeds to ensure a smooth and consistent spray pattern under low fuel demand.
2. Medium-Speed Spray Value Test:
   * Tests the injector’s precision and flow rate at medium engine speeds, ensuring proper fuel delivery during everyday driving conditions.
3. High-Speed Spray Value Test:
   * Verifies the injector’s ability to maintain proper spray patterns and fuel atomization under high engine speeds and heavy load conditions.
4. Leak Test:
   * Checks for any leaks at the injector seals or internal components under pressurized conditions, ensuring complete fuel system integrity.
5. Flow Tests at 44 PSI (unless otherwise requested):
   * Measures the injector’s flow rate and spray uniformity at 44 PSI, replicating standard fuel system pressures. If you require testing at a custom PSI, we’re happy to accommodate your request.
6. OEM-Standard Testing:
   * Each injector is meticulously flow-tested to ensure peak performance and reliability.
   * Guaranteed flow rate discrepancy of 4% or less across the entire set, ensuring precise and consistent fuel delivery.

Our advanced testing ensures that every injector provides optimal fuel atomization, consistent flow rates, and a leak-free seal, giving you the confidence of like-new performance. Whether you’re looking for smooth idling, fuel efficiency, or high-performance reliability, our injectors are tested to deliver!
What’s Replaced & During Refurbishment?
Our fuel injectors go through a rigorous reconditioning process to ensure they perform like new. During refurbishment, the following components are replaced:
1. O-Rings:
   * Replaced & lubricated to ensure a proper seal and prevent fuel leaks.
2. Filter Baskets (Micro Filters):
   * Located at the top of the injector, these are replaced to maintain clean fuel flow.
3. Pintle Caps/Nozzle Caps (if compromised):
   * Protect the injector nozzle and ensure proper spray patterns.
4. Seals/Gaskets:
   * All seals and gaskets are replaced & lubricated to maintain a leak-free connection.
5. Spacer Washers (if applicable):
   * Replaced to ensure proper alignment of internal parts.
6. Spray Tips (if damaged):
   * Replaced to restore proper fuel atomization and spray patterns.
In addition to part replacement, the injectors are ultrasonically cleaned to remove carbon and debris and flow-tested to ensure they meet OEM performance standards.

Important Disclaimer
While we stand behind the quality of our refurbished fuel injectors, please note that we do not warranty injectors that fail due to electrical resistance issues. Electrical resistance problems are typically caused by issues within the vehicle’s electrical system (e.g., faulty wiring, connectors, or improper voltage) and are not related to the injector’s refurbishment process.
To ensure proper functionality, we recommend:
* Verifying your vehicle’s electrical system is in good condition before installation.
* Consulting a professional mechanic for proper diagnosis if you suspect electrical issues.
By taking these precautions, you can help protect your injectors and ensure long-lasting performance.
