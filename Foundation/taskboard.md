> ðŸ§© INSTRUCTION: Before making any code changes, read the user's request and fill out this table(this is just an example format, so feel free to modify and add rows). Use it to plan the entire workflow. Update the status as you go.

## Task 2: Integrate Google Places API for live search
- **Status**: done
- **Priority**: high
- **Assignee**: Rob
- **Description**: Integrate Google Places API to enable live search functionality for the fuel injector cleaning services locator page.
- **Details**:
  - Created `google-places-api.js` for Places API integration
  - Updated the search page to use the Places API for live results
  - Enhanced the business-detail page to display API data
  - Implemented geolocation to detect user's location
  - Added fallback to static data when API is unavailable
  - Note: Need to obtain Google API key for production use

## âœ… Completion Prompts for AI

> After completing each step, update the `Status` column. Use one of:
- `pending`
- `in_progress`
- `done`
- `blocked`

> When reaching a coding step:
1. Paste **only relevant files or components**.
2. Apply changes **incrementally**.
3. Include **diffs or before/after snippets**.
4. Confirm when done and move to next task.

---

## ðŸ§  Prompt Logic Rules for AI

1. **Never begin coding until step 4 is complete.**  
2. **Keep planning steps small and modular.**  
3. **Avoid drifting away from the task board.**  
4. **If unsure, create a subtask and clarify.**  
5. **Summarize changes clearly for human review.**

## ðŸ’¡ Example User Request

> "Can you move the navbar to the right and update the call-to-action to say 'Join Now' instead of 'Sign Up'?"

âœ… AI will:
- Fill out the task board
- Plan changes modularly
- Update the status of each task as it progresses
- Code only when scoped and safe
