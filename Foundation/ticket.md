Your job is to:

* Identify the best way to go about fixing them, proceed in fixing them, complete extensive debugging, and resolve the ticket with with no console errors or warnings before we close this ticket  
* Once you have confirmed with me that the ticket is closed, you will fill out the BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF WHAT CAUSED THE ISSUE(S) , BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF WHAT YOU DID TO SOLVE THE ISSUE(S) , WHAT I LEARNED AFTER RESOLVING THIS TICKET THAT COULD HELP ME WITH BUILDING APPS IN THE FUTURE , and WHAT PREPROMPTS WOULD YOU ADD IN A "CODING ETIQUETTE AND PROTOCOL" GUIDE FOR THE CHATBOT THAT BUILT THIS APP WHICH COULD HAVE AVOIDED THIS BUG IN THE FIRST PLACE sections below.

**# ISSUE:**
- Migrate Google Places API usage from the deprecated `PlacesService` (using `textSearch`, `nearbySearch`) to the recommended `google.maps.places.Place` class (using `searchByText`, `searchNearby`) to ensure future compatibility and address console warnings.

**# BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF WHAT CAUSED THE ISSUE(S):**
- Google is deprecating the `google.maps.places.PlacesService` used in the current code. While it still functions, it won't receive non-critical updates, and a newer `Place` class API is recommended. The console displays warnings about this deprecation.

**# BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF WHAT YOU DID TO SOLVE THE ISSUE(S):**
- *(In Progress)* Refactoring the `searchForBusinesses` function in `google-places-api.js`:
    - Replacing `placesService.textSearch()` calls with `google.maps.places.Place.searchByText()`.
    - Replacing the fallback `placesService.nearbySearch()` call with `google.maps.places.Place.searchNearby()`.
    - Explicitly defining the `fields` required from the API in the request objects (e.g., `id`, `displayName`, `formattedAddress`, `location`, `rating`, `photos`, etc.).
    - Updating response handling logic to work with the `Place` object structure and Promises returned by the new methods.

**# WHAT I LEARNED AFTER RESOLVING THIS TICKET THAT COULD HELP ME WITH BUILDING APPS IN THE FUTURE:**
- *(Anticipated)* How to use the newer `google.maps.places.Place` class methods (`searchByText`, `searchNearby`) effectively.
- *(Anticipated)* The importance of explicitly requesting necessary data `fields` when using the new Places API.
- *(Anticipated)* Best practices for handling Promise-based asynchronous API calls.
- *(Anticipated)* The value of proactively migrating from deprecated APIs to maintain application health and compatibility.

**# WHAT PREPROMPTS WOULD YOU ADD IN A "CODING ETIQUETTE AND PROTOCOL" GUIDE FOR THE CHATBOT THAT BUILT THIS APP WHICH COULD HAVE AVOIDED THIS BUG IN THE FIRST PLACE:**
- "When integrating third-party APIs, check the documentation for API versioning and deprecation schedules. Prioritize using the latest recommended stable API versions."
- "If an API being used is marked as deprecated, create a task to migrate to the recommended alternative before the deprecation deadline or as soon as feasible."
